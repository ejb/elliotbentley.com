title:  "Introducing oTranscribe"
---

For the past few weeks, I've been working on a web app called **[oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/)**. It's designed to take the pain out of transcibing recorded interviews by integrating an audio player with a text editor.

Key features:

- **Save time when transcribing** - no need to switch between an audio player and text editor.
- **Never lose your work** - your transcript is automatically saved, even if you close the window.
- **Convenient keyboard controls** to pause/resume, skip forward/back and even insert a timestamp.
- **Interactive timestamps** for swift navigation around audio files.
- **Cutting-edge HTML5 technologies** provide a smooth, desktop-like experience.
- **Open source** [on GitHub](http://github.com/otranscribe/otranscribe) until the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so anyone can help develop it (or even create their own custom version).
- **Free to use, forever**. Yes, really.

Although similar projects exist, oTranscribe is to my knowledge the only one both open source and able to run in a browser.

oTranscribe is currently a work in progress, and I'd love to hear your feedback. You can contact me on Twitter at [@elliot_bentley](http://twitter.com/elliot_bentley) or [@oTranscribe](http://twitter.com/oTranscribe), or <a href="mailto:mail@elliotbentley.com?subject=oTranscribe">via email</a>.
