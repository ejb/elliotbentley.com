How would you like to run an open source project used by thousands of journalists, academics and writers?

My [humble little web app](https://ejb.github.io/2013/10/03/otranscribe.html) turns five this year. I still get a thrill whenever someone tells me it’s helped them in their work, but [I’m kind of done with it](https://ejb.github.io/2017/06/17/excitement-and-terror-of-a-successful-side-project.html). I’m struggling to find the motivation to maintain and upgrade its codebase. With over 100,000 monthly users relying on oTranscribe, I don’t want to do a sloppy job or let it rot away.

So, this is an open call for new a maintainer. It could be an individual or an organisation. I won’t ask for financial renumeration, but you’ll need to convince me that you have a strong commitment to open source and will take good care of the project and its users. If I don’t find anyone suitable, I’ll keep hold of it.
