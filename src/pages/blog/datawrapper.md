I [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/elliot_bentley/status/1562779527779979266) a few weeks ago, and in updating my bio I felt I ought to make it extra official with a blog post.

After eight years at The Wall Street Journal, I've taken on a new job as a senior data visualisation developer at [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de), a company that makes excellent software tools.

Although I expect I will be writing a lot more code in my new role, I can't promise this technical blog will become any more active — but I do hope to contribute to [Datawrapper's own blog](https://blog.datawrapper.de) from time to time. So be sure to ~subscribe in your RSS reader~ [follow them on social media](https://twitter.com/datawrapper).
